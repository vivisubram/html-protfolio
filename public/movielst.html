<h1>The Best Movies According to Vivek</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>Kung fu panda is definitely an animated classic in my book. This movie has it all, great story, amazing characters and character arcs, definitely an entertaining and fun and epic animated movie to watch.</p>
<h3>Anbae Sivam</h3>
<p>The movie of this millennium...need for a peaceful and harmonious world. If humanism is the need of the hour, then 'Anbe Sivam' Nallasivam is the need of this second. Who could have even thought of doing such an epic other than the ultimate humanist, Kamal Haasan.</p>
